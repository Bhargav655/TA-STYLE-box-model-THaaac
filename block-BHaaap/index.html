2. After the heading, there should be a paragraph.
3. After the paragraph add an image having all the corner rounded.
4. Below the image, there should be a circle with red background.
5. At the bottom of the page, there must be a footer containing few links.
6. The H1 has 1px red solid borders, background color #D18C1D, and 10px of space between the content and the border (padding)
7. The paragraph is contained in 600px by 400px boxes with 2px black dotted borders and background color #D1D631

            Good descriptive paragraphs take into account the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sound and sight. Though sight is often considered the first thing a writer notices, sometimes it is best in writing a descriptive paragraph to leave this detail to the end. Instead, start with something less obvious, such as smell or taste. After this the writer can describe what something feels and sounds like. Using varied descriptive words also helps a reader better understand the subject being described.
